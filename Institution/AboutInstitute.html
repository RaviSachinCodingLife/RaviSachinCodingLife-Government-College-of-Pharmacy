            Government College of Pharmacy, Aurangabad was established in 1996
            through the efforts of Honorable Late Shri. Govindbhaiji Shroff as
            part of his social obligation â€” fulfilling a long-standing need for
            the Marathwada region. Initially functioning as a department within
            the Government College of Engineering, it gained status as an
            independent Government College in 1999.
            <br /><br />
            Now housed in a modern 8000 sq. ft. facility, the institute has
            quickly established a reputation for providing quality education.
            Affiliated with Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University,
            Aurangabad and approved by AICTE and the Government of Maharashtra,
            the college offers:
            <br /><br />
            - Four-year B.Pharm. program with an annual intake of 60 students<br />
            - Two-year M.Pharm (Pharmaceutics) with 18 seats<br />
            - A six-year integrated course<br />
            - Facilities for doctoral studies through the university
            <br /><br />
            The college continues to grow as a centre of academic excellence in
            pharmaceutical education and research.
